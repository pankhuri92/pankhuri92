# Hi, Iâ€™m Pankhuri! 

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a CSE Undergrad learning and growing in in C++, C, Python, and frontend technologies. Currently diving into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, I am also expanding my skills in web development, particularly with JS, CSS, HTML, and PHP. My curiosity extends to the realms of artificial intelligence, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges.

## ðŸŒ± Looking to collaborate 
I am open to collaboration on exciting projects. Whether it's coding, web development, or AI-related, count me in!
